      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    Basic data classes for representing context free grammars.  A\n",
      "    \"grammar\" specifies which trees can represent the structure of a\n",
      "    given text.  Each of these trees is called a \"parse tree\" for the\n",
      "    text (or simply a \"parse\").  In a \"context free\" grammar, the set of\n",
      "    parse trees for any piece of a text can depend only on that piece, and\n",
      "    not on the rest of the text (i.e., the piece's context).  Context free\n",
      "    grammars are often used to find possible syntactic structures for\n",
      "    sentences.  In this context, the leaves of a parse tree are word\n",
      "    tokens; and the node values are phrasal categories, such as ``NP``\n",
      "    and ``VP``.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The ``CFG`` class is used to encode context free grammars.  Each\n",
      "    ``CFG`` consists of a start symbol and a set of productions.\n",
      "    The \"start symbol\" specifies the root node value for parse trees.  For example,\n",
      "    the start symbol for syntactic parsing is usually ``S``.  Start\n",
      "    symbols are encoded using the ``Nonterminal`` class, which is discussed\n",
      "    below.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    A Grammar's \"productions\" specify what parent-child relationships a parse\n",
      "    tree can contain.  Each production specifies that a particular\n",
      "    node can be the parent of a particular set of children.  For example,\n",
      "    the production ``<S> -> <NP> <VP>`` specifies that an ``S`` node can\n",
      "    be the parent of an ``NP`` node and a ``VP`` node.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Grammar productions are implemented by the ``Production`` class.\n",
      "    Each ``Production`` consists of a left hand side and a right hand\n",
      "    side.  The \"left hand side\" is a ``Nonterminal`` that specifies the\n",
      "    node type for a potential parent; and the \"right hand side\" is a list\n",
      "    that specifies allowable children for that parent.  This lists\n",
      "    consists of ``Nonterminals`` and text types: each ``Nonterminal``\n",
      "    indicates that the corresponding child may be a ``TreeToken`` with the\n",
      "    specified node type; and each text type indicates that the\n",
      "    corresponding child may be a ``Token`` with the with that type.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The ``Nonterminal`` class is used to distinguish node values from leaf\n",
      "    values.  This prevents the grammar from accidentally using a leaf\n",
      "    value (such as the English word \"A\") as the node of a subtree.  Within\n",
      "    a ``CFG``, all node values are wrapped in the ``Nonterminal``\n",
      "    class. Note, however, that the trees that are specified by the grammar do\n",
      "    *not* include these ``Nonterminal`` wrappers.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Grammars can also be given a more procedural interpretation.  According to\n",
      "    this interpretation, a Grammar specifies any tree structure *tree* that\n",
      "    can be produced by the following procedure:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    | Set tree to the start symbol\n",
      "    | Repeat until tree contains no more nonterminal leaves:\n",
      "    |   Choose a production prod with whose left hand side\n",
      "    |     lhs is a nonterminal leaf of tree.\n",
      "    |   Replace the nonterminal leaf with a subtree, whose node\n",
      "    |     value is the value wrapped by the nonterminal lhs, and\n",
      "    |     whose children are the right hand side of prod.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The operation of replacing the left hand side (*lhs*) of a production\n",
      "    with the right hand side (*rhs*) in a tree (*tree*) is known as\n",
      "    \"expanding\" *lhs* to *rhs* in *tree*.\n",
